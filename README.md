### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The lab sessions adequately prepared me to complete the assignment by covering essential topics such as state management and component lifecycle methods. However, I felt less prepared in areas related to passing props and lifting state, which are crucial for efficient data flow between components. More focused attention on these topics in future lab sessions would further enhance readiness to handle complex React projects effectively.


* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have focused on implementing additional components to streamline the hierarchy and improve the organization of my MovieList.jsx file. This approach would have made the code more concise and easier to comprehend, enhancing maintainability. Additionally, I might have explored adding more interactive features or refining existing functionalities to provide a richer user experience in the application.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Reflecting on my project demo, contacting the API and fetching data worked well, and I successfully implemented useState and useEffect hooks effectively. However, there were some aspects that didn't go as planned, such as managing state transitions between different components smoothly and handling edge cases in data fetching. One thing I noticed from my peers that I would like to try next time is implementing a sidebar or navigation bar to enhance the user interface and navigation experience within the application. This could improve the overall usability and aesthetic appeal of the project.
